# [Growing Schemes: Twenty Years of Scheme Requests for Implementation](arthur-gleckler-growing-schemes-2018.pdf)

by Arthur Gleckler

## Abstract

SRFI, or Scheme Requests for Implementation, is an informal process
for extending the Scheme programming language. It has run in parallel
with, and has sometimes contributed to, more formal Scheme
standardization efforts like R 6 RS and R 7 RS.  Since the inception
of SRFI in 1998, SRFI contributors have prepared 162 detailed
documents proposing extensions to Scheme, most with sample
implementations, and many with test suites as well. SRFIs cover ideas
like mechanisms for concurrency, error handling, internationalization,
and pattern matching; control constructs and data structures; module
systems; operating system interfaces; and more.
In this paper, we explain the purpose of the SRFI process, how the
process works, and how it has been part of the evolution of Scheme. We
hope that implementers and users of Scheme and other programming
languages can benefit from learning about this approach to moving the
language forward.

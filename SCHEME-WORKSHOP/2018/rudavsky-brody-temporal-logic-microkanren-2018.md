# [Temporal Logic, μKanren, and a Time-Traveling RDF Database](rudavsky-brody-temporal-logic-microkanren-2018.pdf)

By Nathaniel Rudavsky-Brody

## Abstract

By adding a temporal primitive to the μKanren language and adapting
its interleaving search strategy to preserve simultaneity in linear
time, we show how a system of temporal relational programming can be
implemented. This system is then applied to a practical problem in
distributed systems and linked data, as we describe a simple data
store that can provide incremental solutions (deltas) to complex
queries as new records are added to, or removed from the database.

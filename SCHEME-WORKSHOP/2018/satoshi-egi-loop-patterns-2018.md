# [Loop Patterns: Extension of Kleene Star Operator for More Powerful Pattern Matching against Arbitrary Data Structures](satoshi-egi-loop-patterns-2018.pdf)

By Satoshi Egi

## Abstract

The Kleene star operator is an important pattern construct for
representing a pattern that repeats multiple times. Due to its
simplicity and usefulness, it is imported into various
pattern-matching systems other than regular expressions. For example,
Mathematica has a similar pattern construct called the repeated
pattern. However, they have the following limitations: (i) We cannot
change the pattern repeated depending on the current repeat count, and
(ii) we cannot apply them to arbitrary data structures such as trees
and graphs other than lists. This paper proposes the loop patterns
that overcome these limitations.  This paper presents numerous working
examples and formal semantics of the loop patterns. The examples in
this paper are coded in the Egison programming language, which
features the customizable non-linear pattern-matching facility for
non-free data types.
